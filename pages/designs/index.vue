                This is a collection of daily/semi-daily design challenges that I've completed. 
                This is a collection of pages that aren't really portfolio pieces, but are examples of work 
                that serve as a personal "can I do X in Y time?".

                Also, if you see a knockoff of your company's homepage here, it's 100% intentional. 
                It means there was something about the design that made me want to see if I could replicate it. 
                Understand, I am NOT going to sell any of these specific designs, and unless I KNOW that an asset 
                I copied from your website are in the public domain, it will never be used in a commercial product.
                And lastly, check your job applications. If I took the time to make a knockoff of your homepage, 
                there's a decent chance that's the reason you're seeing this.
