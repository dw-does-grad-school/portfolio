                There are times in life you need to accept that the best way to be of use to one field 
                is to step away from it as a primary role.
                <br>
                <br>
                By the time I hit my second semester of nursing school, 
                I think I knew that was the case at a subconscious level. It wasn't until taking a week to step away 
                from academics and the hospital setting about midway through the semester that I realized I felt a 
                lot more secure working in my graduate program than in my nursing program. And frankly, I feel that 
                the decision to focus on the former instead of the latter was something that I had always felt like 
                I was going to eventually do. It was also an academic decision at its core. As my career technological 
                GPA is around a 3.8 and climbing, while my nursing GPA is around a 3.2. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, the time I spent in nursing school was to my benefit as it aided me in three critical ways. 
                It taught me how to lock in for 12-15 hours at a time. It was critical in helping me to become a more 
                compassionate individual, who is happier to take the time to listen to others within my group and to 
                lead them down the right path than I had previously been. And it taught me how to have a healthier 
                perspective on things, as a younger version of me would've been far more bitter about leaving the 
                program than the older version, who understands why.

                If you took the time to read this, great! I'd love to talk about this during our conversation, as I feel 
                that this was the foundation that the leader I will become is built upon.
